DirectX11 C++ wrapper/helper libary 

See aldx_demo for a example of how to use it.

Requires Windows 8.1, currently builds a desktop app, but it could be modified for WinStore or WinPhone.

Although this could be the beginings of a game engine, it would be a better idea to use it as a Graphics API abstraction layer, as it is pretty low level
